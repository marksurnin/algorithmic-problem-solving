# A - I Can Guess The Data Structure

There is a bag-like data structure, supporting two operations:

1 x   Throw an element x into the bag.
2     Take out an element from the bag.

Given a sequence of operations with return values, you’re going to guess the data structure. It is a stack (Last-In, First-Out), a queue (First-In, First-Out), a priority-queue (Always take out larger elements first) or something else that you can hardly imagine!

## Input

There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the next n lines is either a type-1 command, or an integer 2 followed by an integer x. That means after executing a type-2 command, we get an element x without error. The value of x is always a positive integer not larger than 100. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

## Output

For each test case, output one of the following:

stack             It’s definitely a stack.
queue             It’s definitely a queue.
priority queue    It’s definitely a priority queue.
impossible        It can’t be a stack, a queue or a priority queue.
not sure          It can be more than one of the three data structures men- tioned above.
