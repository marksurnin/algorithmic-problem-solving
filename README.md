# Algorithmic Problem Solving â€“ New York University, Spring 2017

These are my solutions to the problems solved in this class. Folders with "HW" indicate that these problems were assigned as homework, whereas "RC" means that they were solved in an in-class timed programming contest. The solutions are written in Java. To test them, simply navigate to the folder of your choice, type `javac Main.java` to compile the program, and `java Main < input.txt` to execute it with a provided test case file.
